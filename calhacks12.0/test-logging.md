# 🧪 Testing Repository Fetching and Claude AI Integration

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Testing Guide**

### **1. Start the Application**
```bash
npm run dev

- Go to "Console" tab
- Clear the console (Ctrl+L)

### **3. Navigate to Dashboard**
- Go to `http://localhost:3000`
- Sign in with GitHub
- You should see the dashboard with your repositories

### **4. Watch the Console Logs**

### **5. What to Look For**

#### **✅ Success Indicators:**
- `✅ Repositories loaded successfully` - GitHub repos fetched
- `📁 FullName provided, attempting to fetch repository code...` - Repository code fetching started
- `🤖 Getting Claude AI analysis for: [repo-name]` - Claude AI called
- `✅ Claude AI analysis completed successfully!` - Claude AI succeeded

#### **❌ Failure Indicators:**
- `❌ No GitHub access token found` - Authentication issue
- `❌ No fullName provided - cannot fetch repository code` - Missing repo data
- `❌ Error getting Claude AI analysis:` - Claude AI failed
- `🔄 Falling back to rule-based analysis` - Using fallback instead of Claude AI

### **6. Troubleshooting**

**If you don't see repository loading logs:**
- Check if you're authenticated
- Check if the GitHub repos API is working

**If you don't see Claude AI logs:**
- Check if `fullName` is being passed correctly
- Check if repository code fetching is working
- Check if Claude API key is valid

**If you see errors:**
- Look for specific error messages in the logs
- Check the network tab for failed requests
- Verify your environment variables are set correctly

## 🎯 **Quick Test Checklist**

- [ ] Dashboard loads with repositories
- [ ] Console shows repository loading logs
- [ ] Click "Analyze with AI" on a repository
- [ ] Console shows Claude AI analysis logs
- [ ] Modal opens with analysis results
- [ ] No error messages in console

## 📊 **Expected Results**

You should see a complete flow from repository loading to Claude AI analysis, with detailed logs at each step. If any step fails, the logs will show exactly where the issue occurs.
