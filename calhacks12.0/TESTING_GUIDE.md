# Complete Testing Guide

## How It Works Now

The API testing system can work in **3 modes**:

1. **Mock Mode** (Default) - Shows realistic simulated results
2. **Docker Mode** - Builds and runs actual Docker containers
3. **Local Mode** - Runs servers locally without Docker

---

## 🎯 Current Status: Mock Mode

**Why?** Fast, reliable, great for demos

**What happens:**

- Discovers real API endpoints from code
- Shows realistic test results based on endpoint patterns
- No server setup needed
- Works immediately

**To test:**

1. Click "🧪 Test API Endpoints" on any repo
2. See comprehensive results!

---

## 🐳 Docker Mode (Advanced)

For **real HTTP testing** with actual servers:

### For the Example Test Repo:

1. **Start the local server:**

   ```bash
   cd calhacks12.0/example-test-repo
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. **Then test in your app** - now it will make real HTTP requests!

### For Any GitHub Repo (Future Enhancement):

Would require:

1. Cloning the repository
2. Building Docker image
3. Running container
4. Making actual HTTP requests
5. Stopping and cleaning up

**Challenges:**

- Security (running untrusted code)
- Performance (slow build times)
- Resource management (cleanup)

---

## 💡 Recommendation

For your **CalHacks demo**, stick with **Mock Mode** because:

✅ **Instant results** - No waiting for servers to start
✅ **Reliable** - Always shows good demo data
✅ **Safe** - No code execution
✅ **Shows discovery** - Proves you can find endpoints
✅ **Pretty UI** - Still looks impressive!

**When to use real Docker:**

- Testing your own repositories
- Pre-deployment validation
- Production environments
- When you need actual response data

---

## 🚀 Quick Demo

Just click the button! The mock mode is already configured and working.

**Expected Results:**

- 10-20+ endpoints discovered
- Summary showing pass/fail counts
- Response times
- Expandable details for each endpoint

All the endpoints are **discovered** from the code, the testing is **simulated** for the demo!
